# Parallel & Distributed Computer Systems

## Project 1 - Octree
Creation of an octree with the Morton Code technique. The steps done are the following:
* Hash code calculation
* Bit interleaving
* Most significant digit radix sort
* Reclassification 

The serial code was given and the parallel code was made using Cilk, OpenMP and Pthreads.  <br>
Language: C

## Project 2 - Game of Life
Simulation of the cellular automaton Game of Life.
The serial code was given and the parallel code was made using MPI and OpenMP.  
Language: C

## Project 3 - Non Local Means
MATLAB code was given that implements the pipeline of the Non Local Means algorithm for image denoising. Our task was to improve its performance using CUDA.  
Language: MATLAB, CUDA C

## Project 4 - Backpropagation
This project implements the parallel version of the Backpropagation algorithm for neural networks training, using CUDA.  
Language: C  
Status: Incomplete
